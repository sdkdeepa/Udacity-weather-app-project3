# Weather-app-project3
Weather app

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.


## Steps to get started
From the root directory, initialize node and add the packages by running the following command

- `npm init` 

- `npm i express cors body-parser`

To start the server locally run 

- `node server.js`
